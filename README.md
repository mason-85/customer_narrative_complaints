In this project, the dataset comprises customer narratives concerning various products and services provided by a company. Each entry in the dataset includes three columns: "complaint_no", "product", and "narrative". The "complaint_no" column serves as an identifier for each entry, while the "product" column specifies the type of product or service associated with the narrative. The "narrative" column contains the actual text data, which includes descriptions, complaints, inquiries, or feedback from customers.

The objective of this project is twofold: firstly, to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to gain insights into the types of issues customers are encountering across different products or services. This analysis will aid the company in understanding customer pain points, prioritizing areas for improvement, and ultimately enhancing overall customer satisfaction. Secondly, a model is developed to categorize customer narratives into different product or service categories based on their content. To achieve this, natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM) neural network architecture are utilized.
